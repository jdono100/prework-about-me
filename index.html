      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a young, enterprising techie who is looking forward to starting my career in the tech industry.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I've lived in Channahon, Illinois pretty much my whole life. It's a suburb in the Chicagoland area near Joliet.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love playing video games and going to the gym, playing pick-up sports, and watching <em>The Sopranos.</em></p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Probably something like Steve Wozniak where I'm some sort of visionary-backseat type who has the world in my hands but I still find a way to complain about everything. But for real, probably just owning my own original company.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>My parents house :(</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've always known I'd work in tech and just recently got the motivation to do something about that. Pretty much every company needs the skillset that a full-stack dev brings to the table, and the pay isn't too bad either.</p>
